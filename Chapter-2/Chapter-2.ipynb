    "### Dimensional Consistency\n",
    "All terms in any physically meaningful equation must have the same dimensions. For instance, an equation like:\n",
    "$ L + M = T $\n",
    "(where $  L $ represents units of length, $  M $ represents units of mass, and $  T $ represents units of time)  \n",
    "is dimensionally inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensional Homogeneity\n",
    "An equation is called *dimensionally homogeneous* if each term, separated by plus or minus signs (or set equal), has the same overall dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Buckingham-Pi Theorem\n",
    "If a physical problem involves $  n $ variables (e.g., velocity, length, density) and these variables can be expressed in terms of $  k $ fundamental dimensions (e.g., $  M, L, T, ... $), then the original equation can be rewritten in terms of $  n - k $ dimensionless products (often called Pi groups):\n",
    "$  \\Pi_1 = f(\\Pi_2, \\Pi_3, \\ldots, \\Pi_{n-k}). $\n",

    "- Newton’s 2nd law: $  F = m a $\n",
    "- Logistic equation example: $  \\frac{dP}{dt} = rP \\left(1 - \\frac{P}{K}\\right). $\n",
